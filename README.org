#+TITLE: TimeConv

* What and Why

TimeConv is a world time converter.  The ones I found on the internet
are crappy.  If I Google for “world time converter”, the first several
results are web programs.  And just look at their UI; I have to choose
day, month, hour, minute, etc. from combo lists??!!  Why would anybody
do such an unholy thing??!!  People own keyboards for a reason!  It
surprise me that I couldn’t find any decent one for free (as in either
“free beer” or “freedom”, or maybe I’m just really bad at finding
stuff), so I made one.
