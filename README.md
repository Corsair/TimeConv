TimeConv
========

## What and Why

TimeConv is a world time converter.  It can be used to convert among
three timezones simultaneously (or four, depending on how you define
“simultaneously”), and display two of them at the same time.

The time converters I found on the internet are crappy.  If I Google
for “world time converter”, the first several results are web
programs.  Just a mere look at their UI can kill a minor animal; I had
to choose day, month, hour, minute, etc. from *combo lists*??!!  WTF
program authers???!  For the sake (and safety) of your
cat/dog/lizard/whatever, don’t ever use any of them. It surprised me
that I couldn’t find any decent time converter for free (as in either
“free beer” or “freedom”, or maybe I was just really bad at finding
stuff), so I made one.

needs a manual.  This doesn’t.
